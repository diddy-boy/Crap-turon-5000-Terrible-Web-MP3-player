# Crap turon 5000 Web and MP3 player
A web page based MP3 player that has effects to replicate cheap budget HI-FI, where quantity take precidence of quality.

Plenty of good MP3 players out there, so why not make a terrible one based on a 1990's Hi-Fi...  but made to look like the budget brands.
No expence was spared because there was none to start with ...

Volume control in a misplaced awkward rotation, just like those Temu Hi-Fi systems.... where qaulity takes second place to price.
11 band equalizer.
Has effects that can replicate a budget hi-fi, you know the ones that worked for 5 minutes and then get smashed up.
Also has a Cassette effect that reflects the bad wow and flutter with speed adjustments and noise added, just like cassettes were in yester years of past.
Fake Stero wide in true budget fashion.
Hyper Bass for real low down sub 40hz boost -- Actuallly works better than planned
Speed selectable like an old record 33rpm, 45rpm and 78rpm.

Load your own MP3 songs or select from a list of web radios to listen away.
All effects work on web radio as well as MP3 songs.
No ogg vorbis support, sorry.
