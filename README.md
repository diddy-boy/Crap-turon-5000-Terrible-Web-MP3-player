If you're into quirky, retro-inspired tech with a sense of humour, the Crap-turon 5000 is a delightfully ironic creation. 
It’s a web-based MP3 player designed to mimic the worst of 1990s budget Hi-Fi systems—on purpose...

Volume control in a misplaced awkward rotation, just like those Temu Hi-Fi systems.... where quality takes second place to price. 
11 band equaliser. Has effects that can replicate a budget hi-fi, you know the ones that worked for 5 minutes and then get smashed up. 
Also has a Cassette effect that reflects the bad wow and flutter with speed adjustments and noise added, just like cassettes were in yester years of past. 
Fake Stereo wide in true budget fashion. 
Hyper Bass for real low down sub 40hz boost -- Actuallly works better than planned, 
Speed selectable like an old record 33rpm, 45rpm and 78rpm.

Load your own MP3 songs or select from a list of web radios to listen to.

All effects work on web radio as well as MP3 songs.
No ogg vorbis support, sorry.
just copy and paste the html file and open in a web browser, operating system irrelevant.
